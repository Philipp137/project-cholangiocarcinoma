# Data Storage

This folder contains nothing!
At least inside github it is empty since we dont want to push big data into the git.
But in order to exectue our scripts you may want to drop some data here!

Currently (24.12.2020) we synchronice this folder with the tubcloud data folder named
"project-cholangiocarcinoma". 
Invited users can access it via: <https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/f/2609679350>
If you have a local copy of the data then you may want to symlink it to githubs data 
folder. Therefore I execute the shell command inside the github root folder:

  ln -s ~/tubCloud/project-cholangiocarcinoma ./data/
